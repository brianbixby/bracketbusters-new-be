## How to use?
Clone this repo, cd into the root of the project, run `npm i` from your command line to install all of our dependencies. Please make sure that you have mongodb and httpie installed on your machine. You can brew install them both if you do not already have them with `brew install httpie mongodb`. Please refernce the installation instructions for MongoDB `https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/`, there are typically 1 or 2 quick things you need to do after you Brew install it. 

Run `npm run start` from terminal to start the server. Open a new tab in terminal and run `mongod` to start the Mongo process. Open another terminal tab and run `mongo` to open a Mongo shell (for viewing the contents of your local database). Lastly, open up a final terminal tab; this is where you will be making all of your server requests. Instructions and examples are below.
